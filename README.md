# Comp-Graphic-Reflection
Reflection for Final Project of Comp Graphic

Designing Software:

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Coding aside I think a design skill I learned was how to think about 3D space differently, seeing how they interact with each other.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
The basic process was try to implement what the instructions called for, maybe add my own twist, then test it and then refine it.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
This mindset of keeping things modular and then slowly refining it could definitely be applied to any sort of programming, but also probably any type of work.

Developing Programs:

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
The way this project was formatted everything was kind of done in a modular fashion. This was the perfect way for me to learn how to gradually develop things as time went on and as I learned more. 

How did iteration factor into your development?
As far as development and process goes, iteration was basically everything, slowly building testing and refining was the cornerstone of my process.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
A more structured approach has been key to keeping the code modular and scalable, allowing it to grow to the size of the final project by the end.



How Computer Science can help me:

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
As someone with a growing passion for game development, computational graphics and visualizations give me great knowledge for future projects. Building 3D scenes, working with shaders, and understanding how to render will be invaluable tools in my toolbox moving forward.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Assuming I can get a job in computer science whether it be as a software engineer, game developer, or in UI/UX development, everything I've learned in this class and practiced would be very useful for furthering my career. Learning how to code in a modular fashion, and deal with more visual programming are invaluable.
